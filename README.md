# react-blog
Project I build with React on front-end and Ruby on Rails on back-end.  
For styling I used styled components.  
This is a fully functional, responsive Blog with admin panel for adding or editing posts, creating user profile to be able to comment on posts etc.  
Base design taken from: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog/
